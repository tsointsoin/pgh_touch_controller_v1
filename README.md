# VL1 Touch Controller Firmware

This repository contains the source code for the firmware of the VL1 Touch Controller, a Eurorack module. The firmware is Arduino-based and was originally developed for internal use by the module's creators.

This is a modified version of the official Pittsburgh Modular Touch Controller firmware with two added per-step parameters:

- Ratchet: 1–10 repeats per step, tempo-synced  
- Probability: 10–100 % in 10 % steps  

All original functions (mono/duo sequencing, rest, clock division, Y-axis CV, gate behavior) remain unchanged.

### How to set ratchet/probability

1. Record a step as normal  
2. The last-entered step is automatically selected  
3. Hold REST > 1 second → enter edit mode (LED double-blinks)  
4. Default = Probability mode (LED duty-cycle shows current %)  
5. Short tap REST → switch to Ratchet mode (LED blinks N times repeatedly)  
6. Tap REST again → back to Probability  
7. Tap pad 0–9 → set value (0 = 10 %, 9 = 100 % or 10× ratchet) → exits edit mode  
8. Release REST → also exits

New steps default to 1× ratchet and 100 % probability.

### Hardware / flashing

- Board in Arduino IDE: Arduino Due (Native USB Port)  
- Upload via ISP programmer (USBasp, etc.) to the 6-pin header  
- Library: CapacitiveSensor (standard)

Same calibration variables as stock firmware (`switchThreshold`, `switchSamples`, etc.).

No step LEDs during playback and no sequence memory (same as stock).

Tested and used by many owners since 2024. Works reliably on both original and silver-face units.
